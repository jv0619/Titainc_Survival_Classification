## Overview

This project is a Titanic Survival Classification task implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not. The model for this project is developed using the Decision Tree algorithm. The analysis and code are presented in a Jupyter Notebook for easy understanding and reproducibility.

## Dependencies

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical operations.
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/): For data visualization.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): For building and evaluating machine learning models.

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is provided as `train.csv`. It contains various features about passengers, including their age, gender, class, and more. The target variable is "Survived," where 1 indicates that the passenger survived, and 0 indicates otherwise.

## Jupyter Notebook

The main part of this project is contained in the Jupyter Notebook file:

- `Titanic_Survival_Classification.ipynb`: This notebook contains all the code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation. It provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire project, making it easy to understand and reproduce the results.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-classification.git
   cd titanic-survival-classification
   ```

2. Install the required packages as mentioned above.

3. Start a Jupyter Notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the `Titanic_Survival_Classification.ipynb` notebook in your browser.

5. Follow the notebook's instructions to execute each code cell and explore the project.

## Model Evaluation

The notebook includes model evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.

## Conclusion

This project showcases a Titanic Survival Classification model implemented using the Decision Tree algorithm in a Jupyter Notebook. It offers transparency and step-by-step explanations for each part of the project. Feel free to customize and enhance the code or experiment with different machine learning algorithms to improve the model's accuracy. Good luck with your Titanic survival classification project!
